                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Supply Chain Management and Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas. I enjoy solving problems and taking on new challenges. I believe in always being open to learning and growing, not setting a limit for myself.

                <p>“Life may present with many challenges but none should go down without a fight”</p>
                <p>
                    I think my writing skills are standard; however, I believe there is room for improvement, and by practicing a lot, I can be at my absolute best.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think my oral communication improved a lot this semester. After taking part in this course, I learned a lot about how to communicate effectively, which I believe will help me going forward. Oral communication is really important in any career field, so I believe it is essential to be a strong communicator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, I was a little worried and shaky about this, but then when I started taking part, I enjoyed it and, in fact, did it a few times to improve myself being in front of the camera in an interview. I think it will really help me as it gave me confidence, and it was a good way to practice for interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presentation was a really good experience. Once again, my team members and I were a bit worried in the beginning, but we practiced a few times and started to feel comfortable. I think the topic was a good one too, which involved useful research, and I am really glad that I was able to take part in this. I learned to be calm in front of audiences and deliver a speech by providing useful information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My experience has been a good one so far. Although it is a school where most people are focused on academics and not so much on socializing, I was still able to make good connections and friends. I also took part in career fair events, which was an awesome experience. Overall, people are really friendly and supportive and also very focused on academics. I also met some really amazing professors from whom I learned a lot in class. Taking part in some of the assignments were really great experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on doing an internship in the summer of 2025, and I am actively looking for opportunities and also applying.
